# IoCFX

## What is it?

IoCFX is a minimal Inversion of Control framework designed to improve the usability of JavaFX when running it from within OSGi or a similar framework/container/plugin host.

## Why is it?

JavaFX is monolithic. It assumes that there is exactly one application running in the JVM that requires a UI and that the UI's lifecycle is bound to that of the JVM (i.e. when the UI terminates, the entire JVM needs to be restarted to bring it back up).

In an OSGi environment, the number of applications sharing the same JVM is potentially arbitrary and so is the number of bundles that want to bring their own UI. If every bundle, that wants to show a UI runs Application.launch(), chaos ensues.

There are basically two ways to approach this issue:

1. Allow plugins to create their own Application using an alternative to Application.launch() that can be called more than once per JVM. This is what the SubApplicationFX project does.
2. Give plugins a way to publish their desire to be assigned a UI and let the framework provide them one when it's ready (Inversion of Control). This is what IoCFX does.

## Why use it?

IoCFX was designed with maximum simplicity in mind. If you already have an OSGi framework running and want it to have a UI, let your UI bundle provide a StageConsumer instance and make sure that the net.bbmsoft.iocfx bundle is installed. Voil√†, your UI bundle will be provided with a Stage instance as soon as it gets activated. By letting your StageConsumer also implement the StageConfig interface, you can customize the StageStyle and the behavior of your bundle when the stage is closed. That's it.

If you don't have an OSGi framework running, your UI plugin can register itself to a StageConsumerRegistry singleton, which will have the same result. This of course creates an additional compile time dependency that you can avoid when working with OSGi.

## Why not use it?

IoCFX is designed to be extremely simple. There are other projects out there that do quite similar things but offer more configurability or extra functionality. Not doing so is a deliberate choice in IoCFX. The goal here is to not add anything to your dependency tree that you don't actually use.
However if you do plan to use the additional flexibility other projects offer, they may of course be a better choice for you.
